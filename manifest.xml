  <description brief="This is the library for sick laser scanner."> 
  Original sources from http://sicktoolbox.sourceforge.net/, adapted for rock.
  This library implements the driver for several sick laser scanners.
  Until now only the lms1xx is supported, but support for the ld series and the lms2xx could be easily added.
  For these scanners only the extract_package function is needed (see sourcode). This is not done yet because 
  no laser scanner of this series for evaluation was available.
